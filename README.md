## What is Marked One?

Marked one is intended to be an simple interface where you pass in markdown held, and you will
receive a traversable abstract syntax tree in return. This library is in its EXTREMELY early stages
and will need some decent work to get it into a usable state.

PRs open!

This is based on the simple markdown syntax [currently supported by Github](https://github.com/im-luka/markdown-cheatsheet):
